### HypeBot: A Reddit bot with a flair for kindness

HypeBot is a Reddit bot programmed to store a given 'roster' of Reddit users and, on a timed interval schedule, cycle through each user on it's 'hype list' and select a random post or comment made by that user to 'hype' by leaving a random compliment or positive comment intended to hype up that user's Reddit presence. Redditors can subscribe to HypeBot by visiting the root webpage and submitting their Reddit username, which is then stored in HypeBot's user roster.

### Tools & Tech
HypeBot is built using Redd, a Reddit API wrapper for Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, HTML5/CSS3 and JavaScript/AJAX.
